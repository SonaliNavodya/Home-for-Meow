                    <h2>Groom your cat regularly</h2>
                    <p>Whether your cat has short or long fur, he will benefit greatly from regular brushing or combing. This helps remove the dead hair from his coat so he doesn't ingest it while self-grooming. It also gives you the chance to notice any changes to his body. Irregularities such as lumps, bumps or sore spots can then be investigated right away by your veterinarian.</p>

                    <p>Clean, fresh water is essential for your cat's good health. If your cat doesn't seem to drink from a bowl, consider providing her with a tall glass (some cats don't like to bend down to drink) or a cat fountain. Be sure to replenish the water with a fresh supply every day.</p>

                        <h2>Make sure you have enough litter boxes</h2>
                        <p>A general rule of thumb for litter boxes is one for each cat plus one more. So if you have 2 cats, you should have 3 litter boxes. To encourage good litter box habits, keep the litter boxes clean. This may mean scooping more than once per day. Regular cleaning will also help you notice any changes in your cat's urine or stool, which could indicate a health issue.</p>

                        <p>Not only will this help prevent damage to your furniture, it will help your cat stretch her muscles and keep her claws in top condition. Regular scratching on an appropriate surface such as carpet, sisal, or cardboard helps remove the old layers from your cat's claws.</p>

                        <h2>Notice if your cat starts urinating outside its litter box</h2>
                        <p>Sometimes a cat will urinate outside his litter box if the box is dirty. But before you blame the accident on the state of the litter box or your cat's naughty behavior, schedule a visit to the veterinarian. A change in litter box habits sometimes means that a cat has a urinary tract infection or other medical issue.</p>

                        <h2>Use a cat carrier in the car</h2>
                        <p>Does your cat need to visit the vet? Or are you moving to a new home? Transport your cat in an appropriate carrier designed for pets. Allowing your cat to roam freely in the car can distract you from driving safely, which can lead to accidents that may harm both you and your cat.</p>
